      <p>All submissions to JDS need to follow the ACM author guidelines in addition to the rest of the guidelines described for JDS. The ACM author guidelines are as follows: </p>

      <h2>ORCID Mandate</h2>
      <p>As of November 1, 2021, ACM requires that all accepted journal authors register and provide ACM with valid ORCIDs prior to paper publication. Corresponding authors are responsible for collecting these ORCIDs from co-authors and for providing them to ACM as part of the ACM eRights selection process.  Please note: ACM only requires you to complete the initial ORCID registration process. However, ACM encourages you to take the additional step to claim ownership of all of your published works via the ORCID site.</p>
      <br>

      <p>ORCID provides a persistent digital identifier that distinguishes you from every other researcher through integration in key research workflows such as manuscript and grant submission and supports automated linkages between you and your professional activities - ensuring that your work receives proper recognition. This requirement will also enable ACM to provide improvements to the ACM Digital Library profile data, aid in the detection of undeclared conflicts of interest and other publications-related misconduct in ACM Publications, assist with the implementation of ACM Open, and offer a host of <a href="https://info.orcid.org/researchers/">other researcher benefits</a> to ACM authors and the scientific community.</p>
      <br>
      <p>As corresponding author, you will be required to register for an ORCID when you submit a paper.  Your co-authors should also <a href="https://orcid.org/register">create their individual ORCIDs</a> at that time and add them to their accounts in the manuscript submission system. Otherwise, you will need to enter them individually into the ACM rights system upon paper acceptance and before publication in the ACM Digital Library. Simple instructions for complying with this mandate are provided inside the ACM eRights system.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The <a href="https://authors.acm.org/author-services/orcid-faqs">ACM ORCID FAQ</a> should answer many of your questions.</p>

      <h2>ACM Policies</h2>

      <h2>ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects</h2>
      <p>As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/toc">ACM Publications Policies</a>, including ACM's new <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects">Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.</a></p>


      <h2>ACM Conflict of Interest (COI) Policy</h2>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest">ACM Conflict of Interest (COI) Policy</a> describes what a COI is, who is responsible for being aware of such conflicts, how to manage COIs, and how to report violations.</p>

      <h2>ACM Peer Review Policy</h2>
      <p>ACM recognizes that the quality of a refereed publication rests primarily on the impartial judgment of their volunteer reviewers. Expectations of reviewers and ACM can be found in the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/roles-and-responsibilities#reviewers">Reviewer section</a> of the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/roles-and-responsibilities">Policy on Roles and Responsibilities in ACM Publishing page.</a></p>

      <h2>ACM Computing Classification System (CCS)</h2>
      <p>If your paper has been accepted, please read the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012">HOW TO CLASSIFY WORKS USING ACM'S COMPUTING CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM</a> for instructions on how to classify your document using the CCS and insert the index terms into your LaTeX or Microsoft Word source file. Providing the proper indexing and retrieval information from the CCS provides the reader with quick content reference, facilitating the search for related literature, as well as searches for your work in ACM's Digital Library and on other online resources.</p>

      <h2>Author Rights</h2>
      <p>ACM authors have three ways to manage their publication rights:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A license granting ACM non-exclusive permission to publish—allowing authors to self-manage all rights to their work by choosing to pay for perpetual open access from the ACM Digital Library.</li>
        <li>A publishing license agreement granting ACM exclusive publication rights—by granting ACM the right to serve as the exclusive publisher of a work and to manage ongoing rights and permissions associated with the work, including the right to defend it against improper use by third parties. (This license is roughly the equivalent of ACM’s traditional Copyright Transfer Agreement except that the author continues to hold copyright.)</li>
        <li>ACM's traditional Copyright Transfer Agreement—for authors comfortable with the existing agreement.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additionally, ACM authors may post all versions of their work, with the exception of the final published "Version of Record", to non-commercial repositories such as ArXiv. See the <a href="https://authors.acm.org/author-services/author-rights#h-post">ACM Author Rights page</a> for additional information.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Learn more, including about posting to pre-print servers and institutional repositories, by visiting the <a href="https://authors.acm.org/author-services/author-rights">ACM Author Rights page.</a></p>

      <h2>Open Access</h2>
      <p>ACM has made a commitment to become a fully sustainable and Plan S compliant Open Access (OA) scholarly publisher within approximately five years. ACM offers a number of ways to achieve this goal, including Hybrid OA, Gold OA, and the ACM OPEN program.</p>
      <br>
      <p>JDS is a <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess#gold">Gold OA journal.</a></p>

      <h2>Language Services</h2>
      <p>ACM has partnered with International Science Editing (ISE) to provide language editing services to ACM authors. ISE offers a comprehensive range of services for authors including standard and premium English language editing, as well as illustration and translation services, and also has significant outreach in China. Editing is available for both Word and LaTeX files. As an ACM author, you will receive a generous discount on ISE editing services. To take advantage of this partnership, visit the <a href="https://acm.internationalscienceediting.com/">Dedicated ACM Editing Service</a>. (Editing services are at author expense and do not guarantee publication of a manuscript.)</p>

      <h2>Author-izer Service</h2>
      <p>Once your manuscript is published, this service allows you to generate and post a link on your home page or institutional repository to your published article. This link will let any visitors to your personal bibliography pages download the definitive version of the articles for free from the ACM DL. These downloads will be recorded as part of your DL usage statistics. A detailed description of the service and instructions for its use may be found at the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/acm-author-izer-service">ACM Author-Izer Service page</a>.</p>

      <h2>LaTeX Collaborative Authoring Tool on Overleaf Platform</h2>
      <p>ACM has partnered with <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">https://www.overleaf.com/</a>, a free cloud-based, authoring tool, to provide an ACM LaTeX authoring template. Authors can easily invite colleagues to collaborate on their document. Among other features, the platform automatically compiles the document while an author writes, so the author can see what the finished file will look like in real time. Further information can be found at <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions">https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions</a>. The ACM LaTeX template on Overleaf platform is available to all ACM authors <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/acm-official#.WOuOk2e1taQ">https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/acm-official#.WOuOk2e1taQ</a>.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Kudos Article Sharing Platform</h4>
      <p><a href="https://info.growkudos.com/landing/researchers">Kudos</a> is a free service that you can use to promote your work more effectively. After your paper has been accepted and uploaded to the ACM Digital Library, you'll receive an invitation from Kudos to create an account and add a plain-language description. The Kudos “Shareable PDF” allows you to generate a PDF to upload to websites, such as your homepage, institutional repository, preprint services, and social media. This PDF contains a link to the full-text version of your article in the ACM DL, adding to download and citation counts.</p>

      <h2>Author Gateway</h2>
