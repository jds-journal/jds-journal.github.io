      <p>JDS is committed to the promotion of diversity and inclusion in all aspects of our professional activities. We celebrate the diversity in our community and welcome everyone regardless of age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, country of origin, religion, sexual orientation, physical ability, education, and work experience. We also welcome people and opinions of all political persuasions, as long as they abide by the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acm.org%2Fabout-acm%2Fpolicy-against-harassment&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw3i95jOoKWD518yfGPS2YnI">ACM policy against harassment.</a></p>
      <br>    
      <p>As we pursue more initiatives, we may have some missteps. We value your feedback and ideas to help us all build a healthier and more welcoming community.</p>        

      <h2>Inclusion and Diversity in Writing</h2>
      <p>Diversity is achieved when the individuals around the table are drawn from a variety of backgrounds and experience, leading to a breadth of viewpoints, reasoning, and approaches (also referred to as "the who"). Inclusion is achieved when the environment is characterized by behaviors that welcome and embrace diversity ("the how"). Both are important in our writing and other forms of communication such as posters and talks.</p>

      <h2>Inclusion</h2>
      <p>Be mindful of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Of course, exclusionary or indifferent treatment can arise unintentionally. Be vigilant and actively guard against such issues in your writing. Reviewers will also be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise in your submissions. Here are some examples of such issues for your benefit:</p>
      <h4>Examples of exclusionary and other non-inclusive writing to consider avoiding:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="higlight">Implicit assumption</span>: An example of database integrity constraints: "Every person has a mother and a father." This example is exclusionary and potentially hurtful to people from single-parent households and people with same-sex parents.</li>
        <li><span class="higlight">Oppressive terminology</span>: Using the term "Master-Slave" to describe a distributed data system architecture. This can be hurtful to people whose families have suffered the inhumanity of enslavement. A good source of alternative terms to oppressive language often used in computer science can be found in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-knodel-terminology-10.html">this article.</a></li>
        <li><span class="higlight">Marginalization of URGs</span>: An example of attribute domains: "The Gender attribute is either Male or Female." This example is exclusionary and potentially hurtful to people who are intersex, transgender, third gender, two-spirit, agender, or have other non-binary gender identities.</li>
        <li><span class="higlight">Lack of accessibility</span>: Using color alone to convey information in a plot when good alternative data visualization schemes exist. This can be exclusionary to people who are color-blind. Please consider using patterns, symbols and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures, rather than using colors alone. Use a color-blind friendly palette that is designed with accessibility for visually impaired people. Avoid bad color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple.</li>
        <li><span class="higlight">Stereotyping</span>: Reinforcing gender stereotypes in names or examples of roles, e.g., using only feminine names or presentations for personal secretary or assistant roles.</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>Diversity</h2>
      <p>Going further, please also consider actively raising the representation of URGs in your writing. Diversity of representation helps create an environment and community culture that could ultimately make our field more welcoming and attractive to people from URGs. This is a small but crucial step you can take towards celebrating and improving our community’s diversity.</p>
      <h4>Examples of infusing diversity into writing to consider adopting:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="higlight">Embracing different cultures</span>: Names of people are a visible way to enhance diversity of representation in writing. Instead of reusing overused names in computing such as Alice and Bob, consider using names from a variety of languages, cultures, and nationalities, e.g., Alvarez and Bano. Avail of the many online resources on this front for ideas, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Names_by_culture">this article</a> on names across different cultures.</li>
        <li><span class="higlight">Embracing differences in figures</span>: Depictions of people or people-like icons in illustrations are also a good avenue to enhance diversity of representation. Consider depicting people of different gender presentations, skin colors, ability status, and other visible attributes of people.</li>
        <li><span class="higlight">Embracing gender diversity in pronouns</span>: Consider using a variety of gender pronouns across your named examples consciously, including "he/him/his," "she/her/hers," and "they/them/theirs". Likewise, consider using gender-neutral nouns when referring to generic roles, e.g., "chairperson" or just "chair" instead of "chairman," and gender-neutral pronouns for such roles.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Responsibility</h2>
      <p>Finally, if your work involves data-driven techniques that make decisions about people, please consider explicitly discussing whether it may lead to disparate impact on different groups, especially URGs. Consider discussing the ethical and societal implications. For example, see <a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/what-are-important-ethical-implications-using-facial-recognition-technology-health-care/2019-02">this article</a> discussing the potential for disparate impact of facial recognition in healthcare and strategies to avoid or reduce harm. This <a href="http://wp.sigmod.org/?p=1900">SIGMOD Blog article</a> also gives a comprehensive overview of various dimensions and approaches for responsible application of data management ideas. We hope our community can help permeate this culture of responsibility and awareness about potentially harmful unintended negative consequences of our work within the larger computing landscape.</p>
